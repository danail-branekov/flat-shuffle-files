A simple command line tool to copy all files from a directory tree to a single flat directory. 
While doing that the tool would append a random prefix to each file name, thus "randomising" their order. 

A typical usage of the tool is to shuffle files from your music collection into an e.g. USB stick to be used in simple car audio players that cannot shuffle tracks.
